Wireless network watchdog
=========================

This is a simple script that resets a network interface if the Internet
connection stops working. This is usually needed in wireless networks if
the WLAN or 3G client needs to re-connect in order to continue the
service.

Installation
------------

/sbin/ip route | egrep '^default ' | \
 sed -e 's,.* dev \([a-zA-Z0-9]*\).*,DEV=\1,' \
 >/usr/local/etc/wireless_watchdog

wget -O /usr/local/sbin/wireless_watchdog https://[github link]
