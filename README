Wireless network watchdog
=========================

This is a simple script that resets a network interface if the Internet
connection stops working. This is usually needed in wireless networks if
the WLAN or 3G client needs to re-connect in order to continue the
service.

The default cronjob launches the watchdog script every 2 minutes, and it
pings 8.8.8.8 with 10 packets. if none of them were replied, the default
NIC is brought down and then up again.
